## CZ1015 Data Science & AI project
Done by: Tran Hien VAN, Benjamin Tan, Calvin Tan & Yiwei

### What we want to explore:
BASED ON CERTAIN FACTORS, CAN WE DETERMINE WHETHER A FLIGHT IS DANGEROUS OR NOT?

### Data Sets from:
- Kaggle : "Aviation Accident Database & Synopses" by Kheirallah Samaha
- Source: kaggle.com/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses/data (requires login)

### Our Presentation Slides:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WXF-83c5rbf484R4TyAsiDPglpzaKuLVg-r5fBm2k4I/edit?ts=5e8c5156

### Data preparation:
Use imbalencing methods to balance the dataset.
### Our Models:
- Multivariate Decision tree
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression

### Conclusion:
Random Forest Model  is the best model to predict our problem. It gives the highest classification accuracy value (0.65) of the models that we used.  High accuracy value indicates reliability of the model. Even though the Logistic Regression Model gives the highest classification recall of around 0.74. However, there is not much linear relationship so the tree model would be preferred instead.
